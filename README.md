# Angular Watchers
**Angular watchers** is the ultimate AngularJS tool which tells you how many active watchers you currently have.
It automatically updates so you can see live how many watcher a page have.
This is perfect to debug any performance issues.

## Features
* Total number of watcher on the current page
* Difference from the last total number of watchers
* Visual graph that plots the number of watchers in time (max 25 plots)
* Choose Iframe where you want to count the watchers
* Expose Angular Modules in a global variable **window.$$am**
* Graph/Counter view toggle
* Dark/Light theme toggle

## How it works
Every 500ms we inject a angular watchers counter and show you that result.

If your page has Iframes you can choose the one you want to target in a dropdown and we will counter the watchers on the given Iframe.

We also expose all the available angular modules and their services on a **window.$$am** variable. This is a usefull shortcut to debug angular services without a need to use *injector().get()* everytime. 


**Note**: This setting if disabled by default.
Enable it on the configuration menu but be aware that it will **initialize every injected services** the module got.
